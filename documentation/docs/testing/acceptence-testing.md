Demonstration of all of the functional and non-functional requirements. This can be a combination of automated tests derived from the use-cases (user stories) and manual tests with recorded observation of the results.

## Automated Tests
 - Consistent testing of real-time updates?

## Manual Tests
 - Recorded walkthrough of each use-case as described
    - Each use case will have its own video and will be embedded here

 - Demonstration of Non-functional requirements
    - Real-time map
    - Smooth on-screen motion
    - Security-based features
