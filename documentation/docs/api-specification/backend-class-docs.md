### User

The User model class defines the object instance of a users document/row in Laravel. It contains a list of all the users collection fields.

**Data fields:**

- **`fillable`: array**
  - The attributes that are mass assignable.
- **`hidden`: array**
  - The attributes that should be hidden for serialization.
